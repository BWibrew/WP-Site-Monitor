== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does authentication work with this plugin? =

Because this plugin just extends the official REST API, you can use any authentication method the REST API supports.
You may want to use a another plugin to add extra authentication methods such as
[WordPress REST API â€“ OAuth 1.0a Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-oauth1/) or
[JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/)
