## Frequently Asked Questions
### How does authentication work with this plugin?
Because this plugin just extends the official REST API, you can use any authentication method the REST API supports.
You may want to use a another plugin to add extra authentication methods such as 
[WordPress REST API â€“ OAuth 1.0a Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-oauth1/) or 
[JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/)
